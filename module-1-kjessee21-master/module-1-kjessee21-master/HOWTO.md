## About MIPS
MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture, currently used mostly in video game consoles and routers. It is also a popular architecture in introductory courses and textbooks on computer architecture, due to its simplicity relative to x86 and ARM. Here we use the 32-bit instruction set; a 64-bit instruction set also exists.

## Software Requirements
For this class, we use the popular MIPS simulator [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/). Download the MARS jar archive from the MARS website and place it somewhere easily accessible. Also install the Java SDK if you do not have it already.
MIPS is a simple assembly language. If you have done some assembly language programming before, you may be able to get started with just [a reference card](http://www.cburch.com/cs/330/reading/mips-ref.pdf).
